# Composite Prototype for my family Tree project. 
Update: 27/01/2021, About the DFS Algorithm, i'm not going to use it in my family tree project at first, as the DBMs has his own ways of searching, and has his own algorithm to specify which execution plan, so i don't know if i will speed up or just slow down the DBMS by using DFS Algorithm.
